# vec_mem_heap
An object_pool intended to support efficient creation of tree-like datastructures within Rust's memory model.
I'm pretty sure the documentation doesn't suck that badly, but if it does complain and I'll fix it.
Feel free to feature request, stuff like thread safety (atomics) is eventually planned, but first I need to figure out exactly what structure'll best fit my usecase of async read/write.
